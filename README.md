The rise of antimicrobial resitance (AMR) across the world is endangering the efficacy of our antibiotics and putting millions of lives at risk.<br>
This classification project demonstrates the power of machine learning algorithms for predicting antibiotic resistance in _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_, the bacterial cause of the sexually transmitted disease (STD), gonorrhoea.<br>
By interrogating the bacterial genome and identifying genetic factors of antibiotic resistance, we are better placed to make informed decisions on antibiotic stewardship.
